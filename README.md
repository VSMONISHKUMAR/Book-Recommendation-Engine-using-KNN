# Book-Recommendation-Engine-using-KNN

This repository contains a Book Recommendation Engine built using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in Python. The engine uses the Book-Crossing dataset to recommend books based on user ratings.

## Overview

The Book Recommendation Engine leverages user ratings to find and recommend books similar to a given book. Using the KNN algorithm, it identifies books with similar user rating patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the [Book-Crossing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/bookcrossing-dataset) from Kaggle, containing:
- `BX-Books.csv`: Book details.
- `BX-Users.csv`: User details.
- `BX-Book-Ratings.csv`: Book ratings by users.
